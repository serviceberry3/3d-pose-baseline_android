# The model output consist of 2 parts:
# - heatmaps (9,9,17) - corresponds to the probability of appearance of 
# each keypoint in the particular part of the image (9,9)(without applying sigmoid 
# function). Is used to locate the approximate position of the joint. (There are 17 heatmaps.)
# - offset vectors (9,9,34) is called offset vectors. Is used for more exact
#  calculation of the keypoint's position. First 17 of the third dimension correspond
# to the x coordinates and the second 17 of them correspond to the y coordinates

#With heatmaps we can find approximate positions of the joints. After findingindex for maximum value we
#upscale it w/output stride value and size of input tensor. After that we can adjust positions w/offset vectors.

#Pseudocode for parsing output:
#for every keypoint in heatmap_data:
#    1. find indices of max values in the 9x9 grid
#    2. calculate position of the keypoint in the image
#    3. adjust the position with offset_data
#    4. get the maximum probability
 
#    if max probability > threshold:
#      if the position lies inside the shape of resized image:
#        set the flag for visualisation to True
